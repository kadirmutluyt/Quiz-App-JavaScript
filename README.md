# JavaScript Quiz App

This is an interactive quiz application built to test users' knowledge. It's developed purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The questions for the quiz are embedded directly within the JavaScript source code.

## Overview

The application presents users with a series of multiple-choice questions, evaluates their answers in real-time, and displays a final score at the end of the quiz. It features a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.

This project was created for my personal development to improve my skills in front-end web technologies.

## Features

- **Static Questions:** Questions are hardcoded directly into the JavaScript file, making the app standalone and easy to run.
- **Multiple-Choice Answers:** Each question offers several choices for the user to select from.
- **Scoring System:** Tracks the user's score based on correct answers.
- **Results Screen:** Shows the total number of correct/incorrect answers and the final score upon completion.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully compatible with both mobile and desktop devices, powered by Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS3:** For styling and visual design.
- **Bootstrap 5:** For responsive layout and pre-styled components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the application logic, DOM manipulation, and interactive features.
